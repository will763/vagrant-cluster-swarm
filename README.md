# vagrant-cluster-swarm  :book:
In this Project Challenge I created a local Swarm Cluster, using virtual machines, in addition to applying knowledge in Vagrant.
I also learned a way to avoid the implementations manually thus improving the performance of the developers.

## Resources ðŸ“™
- three virtual machines with ubuntu system installed.
- three virtual machines with docker installed.
- one virtual machine is called master and the others are works.
- all the configuration is in the Vagrantfile.
